Game Name: Hey There, Big Boy! \
\
Intent: Provide a level based adventure with a frame story. \
\
Structure: NPCs talk with the player character in between levels, giving exposition and instructions for how to proceed. \
\
Mechanics: Talking to NPCs, entering levels, eating fish, losing energy, running from orcas. \
\
Aesthetics: Meant to invoke a cold, yet fun aesthetic in music, backgrounds, and sprites. \
\
Joys: I (Eden) made all original art for the interactive scenes, as well as two original tracks. It was very fun! \
\
Struggles: So. Many. Assets. Also that time when Unity decided to delete all the game objects in the level select scene. \
