# CSCI-370-5 
Game Name: Hey There, Big Boy! \
\
Intent: Provide a level based adventure with a frame story. \
\
Structure: NPCs talk with the player character in between levels, giving exposition and instructions for how to proceed. \
\
Mechanics: Talking to NPCs, entering levels, eating fish, losing energy, running from orcas. \
\
Aesthetics: Meant to invoke a cold, yet fun aesthetic in music, backgrounds, and sprites. \
\
Joys: \
Eden - I made all original art for the interactive scenes, as well as two original tracks. It was very fun! \
\
Fin - I made all of the menu systems from memory this time, except for the new options menu, which felt pretty good (since I didn't need to watch a tutorial for it). I also really enjoyed learning how to make the options menu. \
\
Colten - I enjoyed balancing the different levels. Finding the balance between not too easy and not too difficult was very rewarding for me. \
\
Struggles: \
Eden - So. Many. Assets. Also that time when Unity decided to delete all the game objects in the level select scene. \
\
Fin - There are also very few correct tutorials on how to do sound menus in Unity. I would, though, recommend the tutorial "How To Add Sound Effects the RIGHT Way | Unity Tutorial" by Sasquatch B Studios. The name doesn't do it justice, it lines up how to play sound effects in a way that makes it much easier to build upon, how to set up a sound effects menu, and how to make mixers for sound in Unity. \
\
Colten - Trying to get the fish to act correctly. The flocking behavior never worked as intended and I ironically found that just removing it made it work closer to what I had envisioned. \
